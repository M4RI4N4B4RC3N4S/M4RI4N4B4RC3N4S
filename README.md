<h1>Hi, I'm Mariana <br/><a href="https://github.com/M4RI4N4B4RC3N4S">Computer Science Student

         
<h2>About Me:</h2> I am taking CS because my physics teacher suggested it was smart to learn a new skill that way I have more job opportunities in the future. Outside of CS I enjoy playing sports, listening to music, and going on road trips.
